# Rockbuster-SQL
Movie rental project
Data Analysis project conducted in SQL for Career Foundry Data Analytics Program.

# Objective
Rockbuster Stealth used to have physical movie rental stores worldwide but now faces competition from streaming services. The company plans to launch an online video rental service using their existing licenses.I  am a data analyst hired by Rockbuster's business intelligence department to help with the launch strategy. My first task is to load all data into an RDBMS and analyze it using SQL to answer any ad-hoc business questions.

# Data
A relational database made up of 17 tables containing data on film rentals, customers, actors, payments, and more.
